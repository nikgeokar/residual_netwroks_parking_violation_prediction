# Parking_Violation_Prediction
Parking violation prediction of Thessaloniki's parking system using Deep Learning

Missing from the data is the history of municipal police scnas as well as the corresponding notebooks where they process this information and analyze it and visualize it out.
This data is unfortunately not publicly available.
In its place we have placed fake randomly generated data so that someone can see the dimension and the type of data while runnig the code

So the actual scans_data file is missing and in its view we have placed the file scans_data2 which is a sample of 1000 rows which are not real and have been generated with random numbers.

The diagram below describes the pipeline of the project
