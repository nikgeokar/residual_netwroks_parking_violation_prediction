# Parking Violation Prediction Using Residual Neural Networks
Parking violation prediction of Thessaloniki's parking system using Deep Learning.


This git repo contains a Deep Learning model for predicting parking violations in Thessaloniki's parking system. Our model has been presented at the IVSMP conference and in the PRLetters journal, and you can find the papers in pdf format in this repository.

Please note that the history of municipal police scans is missing from the data, along with the corresponding notebooks for processing, analysis, and visualization. Unfortunately, this data is not publicly available. Instead, we have included fake randomly generated data in the scans_data2 file, which provides a glimpse of the dimensions and type of data when running the code.

To give you an overview of our project, the diagram below outlines the pipeline of our model.
